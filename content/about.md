Hi, I am currently working as a Senior Software Engineer in Melbourne, Australia.
I work on Javascript related technologies while trying continuously learn new technologies.

As the saying goes _**“When one teaches, two learn.”**_

So, in this blog I try to share the things that I know and still learning.
