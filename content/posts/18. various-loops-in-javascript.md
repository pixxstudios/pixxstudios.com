This post will focus on the _various loops_ available in the javascript and when to use them.

1. _**for**_ - Probably the most commonly used loop in any programming language. The for loop runs until a specific condition is true. As seen below, it has 3 parts:

i) initialization (i=0)  
ii) condition (i<5)  
iii) increment/decrement (i++/i-\-)

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

```javascript
for (let i = 5; i >= 0; i--) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

2. _**while**_ - While loop continues to run as long as the condition is true. The syntax is as follows. If there is no change in condition, then the loop will run infinitely.

```javascript
while (condition) {
  // do something
}
```

3. _**for...in**_ - _for...in_ loop is useful to iterate over an object. It returns the properties defined in that object.

```javascript
const obj = {
  id: 1,
  location: "Melb",
  available: true,
};

for (let o in obj) {
  console.log(o);
}

// output
// id
// location
// available
```

The values associated with properties can be accessed as follows.

```javascript
const obj = {
  id: 1,
  location: "Melb",
  available: true,
};

for (const o in obj) {
  console.log(o, obj[o]);
}

// output
// id 1
// location Melb
// available true
```

4. . _**for...of**_ - _for...of_ loop is useful to iterate over an _iterable object_. It returns the properties defined in it. Iterable object can be anything that can looped be through, for ex, Array, Map, Set and even String is iterable object

```javascript
const str = "sample";

for (const s of str) {
  console.log(s);
}

/*
s
a
m
p
l
e
*/
```

Note: Trying to use _for...of_ with an object will result in

```javascript
Uncaught TypeError: obj is not iterable
```
