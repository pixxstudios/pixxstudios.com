We will understand and see how to create an executable javascript file using a global command.

Lets say for example you want to create a clone of 'ls' or 'cmd' command which shows the content of the current folder or from the path provided. To acheive that we need to have a global command.

To acheive this we need to do couple of things and need to have 2 files (index.js and package.json)

1. index.js will have the code that you to execute when running the command
2. package.json helps the binding the command to the index.js file


1) Create the file index.js in your project folder
```javascript
  #!/usr/bin/env node

  console.log("This file will be an executable file");
```

The first line in index.js **#!/usr/bin/env node** tells the system what interpreter to pass the file to for execution.

Since Tuples are just arrays, so it will allow to push a new element **only of type either string or number** as defined in the _tupleType_ below. But if we try to access the element at that index, it will give an error message.

```typescript
  type tupleType = [string, number];

  const t: tupleType = ['hello', 1];

  // Inserting any other type except string or number will result in error
  t.push(2);

  console.log(t[0]); // hello

  console.log(t[1]); // 1

  // Tuple type 'tupleType' of length '2' has no element at index '2'.
  console.log(t[2]);
```

Tuples can also have an optional value which comes at the end. Optional properties can be defined by using ? (question symbol) after the property type.

```typescript
  type tupleType = [string, number, boolean?];

  const t: tupleType = ['hello', 1];

  /* If you mouse over the length below 
  it states that length can be either 2 | 3
  */
  console.log(t.length); // 2
```
