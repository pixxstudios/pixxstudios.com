## Types

A _type_ helps in defining the shape or structure of the javascript value. A type can consist of a single property or method or can have combination of multiple properties and methods.

For example, the type of variables below can be inferred by typescript by checking the values assigned to them.

```javascript
let id = 123; //number
let name = "Gagandeep Singh"; //string
let skills = ["javascript", "react"]; // string[]
```

But in case of an object or complex data structure it's good to define a type beforehand. Adding or removing a property will result in compile time error.

```javascript
type User = {
  name: string,
  id: number,
  age: number,
};

const user1: User = {
  name: "John",
  id: 123,
  age: 30,
};
```

We can also have a _literal type_ while defining types. Which means narrowing the values to what can be assigned to a variable. In below example we can only have one of 3 values ("programmer" | "manager" | "support") that can be assigned to occupation.

```javascript
type User = {
  name: string,
  id: number,
  age: number,
  occupation: "programmer" | "manager" | "support",
};

const user1: User = {
  name: "John",
  id: 123,
  age: 30,
  occupation: "manager",
};
```

Not defining an initial value or type to a variable makes it _any_ type. Any type of value can be assigned to a variable of type _any_. The below example code is valid since 'a' is of type any.

```javascript
let a;
a = 10;
a = {
  id: 123,
};
a = "some string";
```
