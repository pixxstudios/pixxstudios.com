## Union Types

Multiple _types_ can be defined on a value by using the `|` symbol. When a value is expected to have one of many known types, then using union type is the most suitable option (rather than any or unknown).

```javascript
type value = number | boolean;
```

Here value can be either number or boolean.

We can also combine custom type using the union operator.

```javascript
interface house {
  hasDoor: boolean;
  address: string;
}

interface building {
  hasLift: boolean;
  address: string;
}

type houseOrBuilding = house | building

const hb: houseOrBuilding
```

In above case `hb` can only access members that are common to all types in the union.

## Intersection Types

Intersection types on the other hand are useful when we want to combine two or more types to create a custom type. The difference from Union Type is that the types create using intersection will have all members of the combined types. We use `&` symbol to combine types.

Lets reuse the above example,

```javascript
interface house {
  hasDoor: boolean;
  address: string;
}

interface building {
  hasLift: boolean;
  address: string;
}

type houseAndBuilding = house & building

const hb: houseAndBuilding
```

The value `hb` needs to have all 3 properties (hasDoor, hasLift and address) to be a valid _houseAndBuilding_ type.
